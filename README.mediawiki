'''Description:''' A crate for Rust that allows one to read and write bcheck files generated by <a href="https://github.com/bryceac/BCheckbook">BCheckbook</a>.

'''Version:''' 0.3.3

==Notes==

This crate has been tested with Rust 1.59.0 on macOS and with Rust on Windows. It is not known if it will work in earlier versions, though it should if the dependencies are also backwards compatible.

===Why Create this library===

After having made an application that could serve as a Checkbook ledger, I thought it would be nice to create a way to read and write the saves in Rust, 
so that I can create an applications for application besides macOS and iOS, as well as learn more about serde, to see if I can 
customize serialization and deserialization as much as I could with Codable in Swift, and hopefully save others time figuring out how those files are read properly.

While it might be sometime before I can actually use this code to do anything, due to the current state of GUI programming with Rust 
and the fact that I implemented something I am having troubles with on iOS, things <strong>should</strong> be very much usable.

<dt style="font-weight:bold">0.3.1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Add TSV importing and exporting support, by implementing way to create items with tab delimited strings.</p>
<p>Released 5/17/2023</p>
</dd>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">0.3.2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fix TSV support, due to method not being found.</p>

</dd>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">0.3.3</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fix documentation a bit and work on making sure TSV support runs as desired.</p>
<p>Please note that unit tests may need be ran twice because

===Usage===

To use this library, add the following to your <strong>Cargo.toml</strong> file:

<pre>
[dependencies]
bcheck = "0.3"
</pre>

Afterwards, it is as simple as putting in something like this, if you just need the Record type:

<pre>
use bcheck::Record;
</pre>

There ae two other types that can be used when needed, which are <strong>Transaction</strong> and <strong>TransactionType</strong>.

These three should provide everything needed to parse bcheck files properly and do operations on them in code.

====Saving Data====

To save Data, the only thing that <strong>should</strong> be needed is to import the <strong>Save</strong> trait, in addition to the <strong>Record</strong> type, which will enable a save method on vectors of type Vec<Record>.

This can done like this:

<pre>
use bcheck::{ Record, Save }
</pre>

Afterwards, it can be called like this:

<pre>
let records = vec![Record::new()];

if let Err(error) = records.save("/Users/bob/Documents/example.bcheck") {
    println!("{}", error)
}
</pre>

TSV data can be saved by using the <strong>save_tsv()</strong> method instead 
and is similar to what you see above.

====Loading Data====

To load Data, the only thing that should be needed is to load the record type and use one of te following:

<pre>
if let Ok(records) = Record::from_file("/Users/bob/Documents/example.bcheck") {
    print!("{}", records[0])
}
</pre>

This loads from a json file.

<pre>
if let Ok(records) = Record::from_tsv_file("/Users/bob/Documents/example.bcheck") {
    print!("{}", records[0])
}
</pre>

This loads records from a TSV file.

Please note that TSV support was coded in a way 
that it expects 9 columns in total, though some fields can be empty.

As such, it is recommended that you produce the TSV in 
MS Excel or LibreOffice, 
so that you can verify that you have the appropriate number of tabs.

===Creating Date objects===

If you import the <strong>LocalDateTimeStringExt</strong> trait, dates can be created like this:

<pre>
"2021-7-26".local_dateime().unwrap()
</pre>

===Contributing===

If you think you can help make this crate better, feel free to fork this project and make a pull request.

Like the BCheckbook program, I will test the changes, to see if they work as they should.

===Support===

Due to my limited Rust experience, in comparison to my experience with Rust, I cannot provide much support, 
so expect to be on your own.

However, I can try to check things out, so feel free to contact me at the email below:
